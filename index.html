    The Siberian tiger or Amur tiger is a population of the tiger subspecies Panthera tigris tigris native to Northeast
    China, the Russian Far East, and possibly North Korea. It once ranged throughout the Korean Peninsula, but
    currently inhabits mainly the Sikhote-Alin mountain region in south-west Primorye Province in the Russian Far East. In
    2005, there were 331–393 adult and subadult Siberian tigers in this region, with a breeding adult population of about
    250 individuals. The population had been stable for more than a decade because of intensive conservation efforts, but
    partial surveys conducted after 2005 indicate that the Russian tiger population was declining.An initial census held
    in 2015 indicated that the Siberian tiger population had increased to 480–540 individuals in the Russian Far East,
    including 100 cubs.

<br />
<br />

    was followed up by a more detailed census which revealed there was a total population of
    562 wild Siberian tigers in Russia. As of 2014, about 35 individuals were estimated to range in the international
    border area between Russia and China. As of 2022, about 756 Siberian tigers including 200 cubs were estimated to
    inhabit the Russian Far East

<br />
<br />

    The Siberian tiger is genetically close to the now-extinct Caspian tiger. Results of a phylogeographic study comparing
    mitochondrial DNA from Caspian tigers and living tiger populations indicate that the common ancestor of the Siberian and
    Caspian tigers colonized Central Asia from eastern China, via the Gansu−Silk Road corridor, and then subsequently
    traversed Siberia eastward to establish the Siberian tiger population in the Russian Far East. The Caspian and
    Siberian tiger populations were the northernmost in mainland Asia.

<br />

    The Siberian tiger was also called "Amur tiger", "Manchurian tiger", "Korean tiger", and "Ussurian tiger", depending
    on the region where individuals were observed.
