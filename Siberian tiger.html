        The Siberian tiger or Amur tiger is a population of the tiger subspecies
        Panthera tigris tigris native to Northeast China, the Russian Far East,
        and possibly North Korea. It once ranged throughout the Korean
        Peninsula, but currently inhabits mainly the Sikhote-Alin mountain
        region in south-west Primorye Province in the Russian Far East. In 2005,
        there were 331–393 adult and subadult Siberian tigers in this region,
        with a breeding adult population of about 250 individuals. The
        population had been stable for more than a decade because of intensive
        conservation efforts, but partial surveys conducted after 2005 indicate
        that the Russian tiger population was declining.An initial census held
        in 2015 indicated that the Siberian tiger population had increased to
        480–540 individuals in the Russian Far East, including 100 cubs.
      </p>
      <p>
        was followed up by a more detailed census which revealed there was a
        total population of 562 wild Siberian tigers in Russia. As of 2014,
        about 35 individuals were estimated to range in the international border
        area between Russia and China. As of 2022, about 756 Siberian tigers
        including 200 cubs were estimated to inhabit the Russian Far East
      </p>

        The Siberian tiger is genetically close to the now-extinct Caspian
        tiger. Results of a phylogeographic study comparing mitochondrial DNA
        from Caspian tigers and living tiger populations indicate that the
        common ancestor of the Siberian and Caspian tigers colonized Central
        Asia from eastern China, via the Gansu−Silk Road corridor, and then
        subsequently traversed Siberia eastward to establish the Siberian tiger
        population in the Russian Far East. The Caspian and Siberian tiger
        populations were the northernmost in mainland Asia.
      </p>
      <p>
        The Siberian tiger was also called "Amur tiger", "Manchurian tiger",
        "Korean tiger", and "Ussurian tiger", depending on the region where
        individuals were observed.
